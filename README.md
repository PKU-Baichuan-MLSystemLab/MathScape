# MathScape
This is the codebase for the paper MathScape: Evaluating MLLMs in multimodal Math Scenarios through a Hierarchical Benchmark.

# Environments
To set up the environment, use the following commands:
```Shell
conda create -n MathScape python=3.10
conda activate MathScape
```
Then, install the required Python packages:
```Shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data Description

The original dataset comprised 1,369 entries. After manually removing erroneous data, 1,325 entries remain. The images in these 1,325 entries have been renumbered sequentially from 1 to 1,325.

- **math_question_solution_ans.json**  
  This file contains math questions along with their corresponding image IDs, detailed solution processes, and reference standard answers.

- **math_with_class.jsonl**  
  This file decomposes each question into multiple sub-questions (e.g., a single question may consist of 2-3 sub-questions). It includes type labels for each sub-question, knowledge point labels, solution processes for each sub-question, and reference standard answers for each sub-question.

- **question_knowledge.json**  
  This file maps the image IDs of the questions to their corresponding knowledge point classifications.

# MathScape Evaluation

## 1. Model Evaluation
To evaluate multiple models, you can configure the models in the model.py file. This script is responsible for loading the models, processing the questions, and generating the results.
```Shell
model.py
```

## 2. Running Evaluations
To evaluate the models' performance, run:
```Shell
eval.py
```
This script compares the model-generated solutions against the standard answers, evaluates the results, and saves the evaluation data in a jsonl file.

## 3. Assessing Model Performance
Once all models have been evaluated and the jsonl files generated, you can assess the performance of each model.
### 3.1 Judge all the Performances
To assess overall performance, run:
```Shell
judge_all.py
```
This script determines the correctness of each answer, calculates the overall average accuracy for each model, and includes functions like judge_by_xx to read and evaluate the results from the jsonl file. It also allows for evaluating accuracy based on various dimensions such as knowledge points, educational stages, and question types.
### 3.2 Judge by Knowledge Points
To evaluate performance based on specific knowledge points, run:
```Shell
python judge_by_knowledge.py
```

### 3.3 Judge by Educational Stages
To evaluate performance across different educational stages, run:
```Shell
python judge_by_stage.py
```
### 3.4 Judge by Question Types
To evaluate performance based on question types, run:
```
python judge_by_type.py
```
